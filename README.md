# Computer Vision - Object Tracking

Detected moving vehicles using the CCTV footage of an overhead traffic signal. Used the technique of contour detection in order to make out the contours of the moving vehicles on the road. Any moving object has been marked out with a green colored rectangle around it, whilst it moves. Used the OpenCV library, coded in Python.
